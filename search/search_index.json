The goal for those summary documents is to automatically convert them into relevant SI entries using Markdown or LaTeX. The summary will be quickly reviewed by the experimenter, who will then decide whether all data points should be added into the database or whether any experiments should be repeated. All negative results will be added into the database, repetitions will only be requested when the collected data are visibly wrong (e.g., issues with shimming the magnet, blocked injection needles, empty solvent reservoirs). Experimenter handle will be recorded at insertion time for future reference but will not be deposited with the manuscript. Experimenter comments regarding the failure will also be deposited to help troubleshooting in the future.</p>"},{"location":"data_plan/#access-and-storage","title":"Access and storage","text":""},{"location":"data_plan/#licensing","title":"Licensing","text":"<p>The recommended license for data is <code>CC0</code> where possible to allow for greatest interoperability and reusability.

When the project is submitted for publication, we will deposit all the associated data in machine-readable formats (see here) in an open-access repository (Zenodo, figshare or other - to be determined at the time of submission), which we would ask to be cited in any derivative works.
